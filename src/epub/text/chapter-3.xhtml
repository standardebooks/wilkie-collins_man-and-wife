			<p>But two persons were now left in the summerhouse⁠—Arnold Brinkworth and Sir Patrick Lundie.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brinkworth,” said the old gentleman, “I have had no opportunity of speaking to you before this; and (as I hear that you are to leave us, today) I may find no opportunity at a later time. I want to introduce myself. Your father was one of my dearest friends⁠—let me make a friend of your father’s son.”</p>
			<p>He held out his hands, and mentioned his name.</p>
			<p>Arnold recognized it directly. “Oh, Sir Patrick!” he said, warmly, “if my poor father had only taken your advice⁠—”</p>
			<p>“He would have thought twice before he gambled away his fortune on the turf; and he might have been alive here among us, instead of dying an exile in a foreign land,” said Sir Patrick, finishing the sentence which the other had begun. “No more of that! Let’s talk of something else. Lady Lundie wrote to me about you the other day. She told me your aunt was dead, and had left you heir to her property in Scotland. Is that true?⁠—It is?⁠—I congratulate you with all my heart. Why are you visiting here, instead of looking after your house and lands? Oh! it’s only three-and-twenty miles from this; and you’re going to look after it today, by the next train? Quite right. And⁠—what? what?⁠—coming back again the day after tomorrow? Why should you come back? Some special attraction here, I suppose? I hope it’s the right sort of attraction. You’re very young⁠—you’re exposed to all sorts of temptations. Have you got a solid foundation of good sense at the bottom of you? It is not inherited from your poor father, if you have. You must have been a mere boy when he ruined his children’s prospects. How have you lived from that time to this? What were you doing when your aunt’s will made an idle man of you for life?”</p>
			<p>The question was a searching one. Arnold answered it, without the slightest hesitation; speaking with an unaffected modesty and simplicity which at once won Sir Patrick’s heart.</p>
			<p>“I was a boy at Eton, Sir,” he said, “when my father’s losses ruined him. I had to leave school, and get my own living; and I have got it, in a roughish way, from that time to this. In plain English, I have followed the sea⁠—in the merchant-service.”</p>
			<p>“In plainer English still, you met adversity like a brave lad, and you have fairly earned the good luck that has fallen to you,” rejoined Sir Patrick. “Give me your hand⁠—I have taken a liking to you. You’re not like the other young fellows of the present time. I shall call you ‘Arnold.’ You mustn’t return the compliment and call me ‘Patrick,’ mind⁠—I’m too old to be treated in that way. Well, and how do you get on here? What sort of a woman is my sister-in-law? and what sort of a house is this?”</p>
			<p>Arnold burst out laughing.</p>
			<p>“Those are extraordinary questions for you to put to me,” he said. “You talk, Sir, as if you were a stranger here!”</p>
			<p>Sir Patrick touched a spring in the knob of his ivory cane. A little gold lid flew up, and disclosed the snuffbox hidden inside. He took a pinch, and chuckled satirically over some passing thought, which he did not think it necessary to communicate to his young friend.</p>
			<p>“I talk as if I was a stranger here, do I?” he resumed. “That’s exactly what I am. Lady Lundie and I correspond on excellent terms; but we run in different grooves, and we see each other as seldom as possible. My story,” continued the pleasant old man, with a charming frankness which leveled all differences of age and rank between Arnold and himself, “is not entirely unlike yours; though I <em>am</em> old enough to be your grandfather. I was getting my living, in my way (as a crusty old Scotch lawyer), when my brother married again. His death, without leaving a son by either of his wives, gave me a lift in the world, like you. Here I am (to my own sincere regret) the present baronet. Yes, to my sincere regret! All sorts of responsibilities which I never bargained for are thrust on my shoulders. I am the head of the family; I am my niece’s guardian; I am compelled to appear at this lawn-party⁠—and (between ourselves) I am as completely out of my element as a man can be. Not a single familiar face meets <em>me</em> among all these fine people. Do you know anybody here?”</p>
			<p>“I have one friend at Windygates,” said Arnold. “He came here this morning, like you. Geoffrey Delamayn.”</p>
			<p>As he made the reply, Miss Silvester appeared at the entrance to the summerhouse. A shadow of annoyance passed over her face when she saw that the place was occupied. She vanished, unnoticed, and glided back to the game.</p>
			<p>Sir Patrick looked at the son of his old friend, with every appearance of being disappointed in the young man for the first time.</p>
			<p>“Your choice of a friend rather surprises me,” he said.</p>
			<p>Arnold artlessly accepted the words as an appeal to him for information.</p>
			<p>“I beg your pardon, Sir⁠—there’s nothing surprising in it,” he returned. “We were schoolfellows at Eton, in the old times. And I have met Geoffrey since, when he was yachting, and when I was with my ship. Geoffrey saved my life, Sir Patrick,” he added, his voice rising, and his eyes brightening with honest admiration of his friend. “But for him, I should have been drowned in a boat-accident. Isn’t <em>that</em> a good reason for his being a friend of mine?”</p>
			<p>“It depends entirely on the value you set on your life,” said Sir Patrick.</p>
			<p>“The value I set on my life?” repeated Arnold. “I set a high value on it, of course!”</p>
			<p>“In that case, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Delamayn has laid you under an obligation.”</p>
			<p>“Which I can never repay!”</p>
			<p>“Which you will repay one of these days, with interest⁠—if I know anything of human nature,” answered Sir Patrick.</p>
			<p>He said the words with the emphasis of strong conviction. They were barely spoken when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Delamayn appeared (exactly as Miss Silvester had appeared) at the entrance to the summerhouse. He, too, vanished, unnoticed⁠—like Miss Silvester again. But there the parallel stopped. The Honorable Geoffrey’s expression, on discovering the place to be occupied, was, unmistakably an expression of relief.</p>
			<p>Arnold drew the right inference, this time, from Sir Patrick’s language and Sir Patrick’s tones. He eagerly took up the defense of his friend.</p>
			<p>“You said that rather bitterly, Sir,” he remarked. “What has Geoffrey done to offend you?”</p>
			<p>“He presumes to exist⁠—that’s what he has done,” retorted Sir Patrick. “Don’t stare! I am speaking generally. Your friend is the model young Briton of the present time. I don’t like the model young Briton. I don’t see the sense of crowing over him as a superb national production, because he is big and strong, and drinks beer with impunity, and takes a cold shower bath all the year round. There is far too much glorification in England, just now, of the mere physical qualities which an Englishman shares with the savage and the brute. And the ill results are beginning to show themselves already! We are readier than we ever were to practice all that is rough in our national customs, and to excuse all that is violent and brutish in our national acts. Read the popular books⁠—attend the popular amusements; and you will find at the bottom of them all a lessening regard for the gentler graces of civilized life, and a growing admiration for the virtues of the aboriginal Britons!”</p>
			<p>Arnold listened in blank amazement. He had been the innocent means of relieving Sir Patrick’s mind of an accumulation of social protest, unprovided with an issue for some time past. “How hot you are over it, Sir!” he exclaimed, in irrepressible astonishment.</p>
			<p>Sir Patrick instantly recovered himself. The genuine wonder expressed in the young man’s face was irresistible.</p>
			<p>“Almost as hot,” he said, “as if I was cheering at a boat-race, or wrangling over a betting-book⁠—eh? Ah, we were so easily heated when I was a young man! Let’s change the subject. I know nothing to the prejudice of your friend, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Delamayn. It’s the cant of the day,” cried Sir Patrick, relapsing again, “to take these physically-wholesome men for granted as being morally-wholesome men into the bargain. Time will show whether the cant of the day is right.⁠—So you are actually coming back to Lady Lundie’s after a mere flying visit to your own property? I repeat, that is a most extraordinary proceeding on the part of a landed gentleman like you. What’s the attraction here⁠—eh?”</p>
			<p>Before Arnold could reply Blanche called to him from the lawn. His color rose, and he turned eagerly to go out. Sir Patrick nodded his head with the air of a man who had been answered to his own entire satisfaction. “Oh!” he said, “<em>that’s</em> the attraction, is it?”</p>
			<p>Arnold’s life at sea had left him singularly ignorant of the ways of the world on shore. Instead of taking the joke, he looked confused. A deeper tinge of color reddened his dark cheeks. “I didn’t say so,” he answered, a little irritably.</p>
			<p>Sir Patrick lifted two of his white, wrinkled old fingers, and good-humoredly patted the young sailor on the cheek.</p>
			<p>“Yes you did,” he said. “In red letters.”</p>
			<p>The little gold lid in the knob of the ivory cane flew up, and the old gentleman rewarded himself for that neat retort with a pinch of snuff. At the same moment Blanche made her appearance on the scene.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brinkworth,” she said, “I shall want you directly. Uncle, it’s your turn to play.”</p>
			<p>“Bless my soul!” cried Sir Patrick, “I forgot the game.” He looked about him, and saw his mallet and ball left waiting on the table. “Where are the modern substitutes for conversation? Oh, here they are!” He bowled the ball out before him on to the lawn, and tucked the mallet, as if it was an umbrella, under his arm. “Who was the first mistaken person,” he said to himself, as he briskly hobbled out, “who discovered that human life was a serious thing? Here am I, with one foot in the grave; and the most serious question before me at the present moment is, Shall I get through the hoops?”</p>
			<p>Arnold and Blanche were left together.</p>
			<p>Among the personal privileges which Nature has accorded to women, there are surely none more enviable than their privilege of always looking their best when they look at the man they love. When Blanche’s eyes turned on Arnold after her uncle had gone out, not even the hideous fashionable disfigurements of the inflated “chignon” and the tilted hat could destroy the triple charm of youth, beauty, and tenderness beaming in her face. Arnold looked at her⁠—and remembered, as he had never remembered yet, that he was going by the next train, and that he was leaving her in the society of more than one admiring man of his own age. The experience of a whole fortnight passed under the same roof with her had proved Blanche to be the most charming girl in existence. It was possible that she might not be mortally offended with him if he told her so. He determined that he <em>would</em> tell her so at that auspicious moment.</p>
			<p>But who shall presume to measure the abyss that lies between the Intention and the Execution? Arnold’s resolution to speak was as firmly settled as a resolution could be. And what came of it? Alas for human infirmity! Nothing came of it but silence.</p>
			<p>“You don’t look quite at your ease, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brinkworth,” said Blanche. “What has Sir Patrick been saying to you? My uncle sharpens his wit on everybody. He has been sharpening it on <em>you</em>?”</p>
			<p>Arnold began to see his way. At an immeasurable distance⁠—but still he saw it.</p>
			<p>“Sir Patrick is a terrible old man,” he answered. “Just before you came in he discovered one of my secrets by only looking in my face.” He paused, rallied his courage, pushed on at all hazards, and came headlong to the point. “I wonder,” he asked, bluntly, “whether you take after your uncle?”</p>
			<p>Blanche instantly understood him. With time at her disposal, she would have taken him lightly in hand, and led him, by fine gradations, to the object in view. But in two minutes or less it would be Arnold’s turn to play. “He is going to make me an offer,” thought Blanche; “and he has about a minute to do it in. He <em>shall</em> do it!”</p>
			<p>“What!” she exclaimed, “do you think the gift of discovery runs in the family?”</p>
			<p>Arnold made a plunge.</p>
			<p>“I wish it did!” he said.</p>
			<p>Blanche looked the picture of astonishment.</p>
			<p>“Why?” she asked.</p>
			<p>“If you could see in my face what Sir Patrick saw⁠—”</p>
			<p>He had only to finish the sentence, and the thing was done. But the tender passion perversely delights in raising obstacles to itself. A sudden timidity seized on Arnold exactly at the wrong moment. He stopped short, in the most awkward manner possible.</p>
			<p>Blanche heard from the lawn the blow of the mallet on the ball, and the laughter of the company at some blunder of Sir Patrick’s. The precious seconds were slipping away. She could have boxed Arnold on both ears for being so unreasonably afraid of her.</p>
			<p>“Well,” she said, impatiently, “if I did look in your face, what should I see?”</p>
			<p>Arnold made another plunge. He answered: “You would see that I want a little encouragement.”</p>
			<p>“From <em>me</em>?”</p>
			<p>“Yes⁠—if you please.”</p>
			<p>Blanche looked back over her shoulder. The summerhouse stood on an eminence, approached by steps. The players on the lawn beneath were audible, but not visible. Any one of them might appear, unexpectedly, at a moment’s notice. Blanche listened. There was no sound of approaching footsteps⁠—there was a general hush, and then another bang of the mallet on the ball and then a clapping of hands. Sir Patrick was a privileged person. He had been allowed, in all probability, to try again; and he was succeeding at the second effort. This implied a reprieve of some seconds. Blanche looked back again at Arnold.</p>
			<p>“Consider yourself encouraged,” she whispered; and instantly added, with the ineradicable female instinct of self-defense, “within limits!”</p>
			<p>Arnold made a last plunge⁠—straight to the bottom, this time.</p>
			<p>“Consider yourself loved,” he burst out, “without any limits at all.”</p>
			<p>It was all over⁠—the words were spoken⁠—he had got her by the hand. Again the perversity of the tender passion showed itself more strongly than ever. The confession which Blanche had been longing to hear, had barely escaped her lover’s lips before Blanche protested against it! She struggled to release her hand. She formally appealed to Arnold to let her go.</p>
			<p>Arnold only held her the tighter.</p>
			<p>“Do try to like me a little!” he pleaded. “I am so fond of <em>you</em>!”</p>
			<p>Who was to resist such wooing as this?⁠—when you were privately fond of him yourself, remember, and when you were certain to be interrupted in another moment! Blanche left off struggling, and looked up at her young sailor with a smile.</p>
			<p>“Did you learn this method of making love in the merchant-service?” she inquired, saucily.</p>
			<p>Arnold persisted in contemplating his prospects from the serious point of view.</p>
			<p>“I’ll go back to the merchant-service,” he said, “if I have made you angry with me.”</p>
			<p>Blanche administered another dose of encouragement.</p>
			<p>“Anger, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brinkworth, is one of the bad passions,” she answered, demurely. “A young lady who has been properly brought up has no bad passions.”</p>
			<p>There was a sudden cry from the players on the lawn⁠—a cry for “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brinkworth.” Blanche tried to push him out. Arnold was immovable.</p>
			<p>“Say something to encourage me before I go,” he pleaded. “One word will do. Say, Yes.”</p>
			<p>Blanche shook her head. Now she had got him, the temptation to tease him was irresistible.</p>
			<p>“Quite impossible!” she rejoined. “If you want any more encouragement, you must speak to my uncle.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll speak to him,” returned Arnold, “before I leave the house.”</p>
			<p>There was another cry for “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brinkworth.” Blanche made another effort to push him out.</p>
			<p>“Go!” she said. “And mind you get through the hoop!”</p>
			<p>She had both hands on his shoulders⁠—her face was close to his⁠—she was simply irresistible. Arnold caught her round the waist and kissed her. Needless to tell him to get through the hoop. He had surely got through it already! Blanche was speechless. Arnold’s last effort in the art of courtship had taken away her breath. Before she could recover herself a sound of approaching footsteps became plainly audible. Arnold gave her a last squeeze, and ran out.</p>
			<p>She sank on the nearest chair, and closed her eyes in a flutter of delicious confusion.</p>
			<p>The footsteps ascending to the summerhouse came nearer. Blanche opened her eyes, and saw Anne Silvester, standing alone, looking at her. She sprang to her feet, and threw her arms impulsively round Anne’s neck.</p>
			<p>“You don’t know what has happened,” she whispered. “Wish me joy, darling. He has said the words. He is mine for life!”</p>
			<p>All the sisterly love and sisterly confidence of many years was expressed in that embrace, and in the tone in which the words were spoken. The hearts of the mothers, in the past time, could hardly have been closer to each other⁠—as it seemed⁠—than the hearts of the daughters were now. And yet, if Blanche had looked up in Anne’s face at that moment, she must have seen that Anne’s mind was far away from her little love-story.</p>
			<p>“You know who it is?” she went on, after waiting for a reply.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brinkworth?”</p>
			<p>“Of course! Who else should it be?”</p>
			<p>“And you are really happy, my love?”</p>
			<p>“Happy?” repeated Blanche. “Mind! this is strictly between ourselves. I am ready to jump out of my skin for joy. I love him! I love him! I love him!” she cried, with a childish pleasure in repeating the words. They were echoed by a heavy sigh. Blanche instantly looked up into Anne’s face. “What’s the matter?” she asked, with a sudden change of voice and manner.</p>
			<p>“Nothing.”</p>
			<p>Blanche’s observation saw too plainly to be blinded in that way.</p>
			<p>“There <em>is</em> something the matter,” she said. “Is it money?” she added, after a moment’s consideration. “Bills to pay? I have got plenty of money, Anne. I’ll lend you what you like.”</p>
			<p>“No, no, my dear!”</p>
			<p>Blanche drew back, a little hurt. Anne was keeping her at a distance for the first time in Blanche’s experience of her.</p>
			<p>“I tell you all my secrets,” she said. “Why are <em>you</em> keeping a secret from <em>me</em>? Do you know that you have been looking anxious and out of spirits for some time past? Perhaps you don’t like <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brinkworth? No? you <em>do</em> like him? Is it my marrying, then? I believe it is! You fancy we shall be parted, you goose? As if I could do without you! Of course, when I am married to Arnold, you will come and live with us. That’s quite understood between us⁠—isn’t it?”</p>
			<p>Anne drew herself suddenly, almost roughly, away from Blanche, and pointed out to the steps.</p>
			<p>“There is somebody coming,” she said. “Look!”</p>
			<p>The person coming was Arnold. It was Blanche’s turn to play, and he had volunteered to fetch her.</p>
			<p>Blanche’s attention⁠—easily enough distracted on other occasions⁠—remained steadily fixed on Anne.</p>
			<p>“You are not yourself,” she said, “and I must know the reason of it. I will wait till tonight; and then you will tell me, when you come into my room. Don’t look like that! You <em>shall</em> tell me. And there’s a kiss for you in the meantime!”</p>
			<p>She joined Arnold, and recovered her gaiety the moment she looked at him.</p>
			<p>“Well? Have you got through the hoops?”</p>
			<p>“Never mind the hoops. I have broken the ice with Sir Patrick.”</p>
			<p>“What! before all the company!”</p>
			<p>“Of course not! I have made an appointment to speak to him here.”</p>
			<p>They went laughing down the steps, and joined the game.</p>
			<p>Left alone, Anne Silvester walked slowly to the inner and darker part of the summerhouse. A glass, in a carved wooden frame, was fixed against one of the side walls. She stopped and looked into it⁠—looked, shuddering, at the reflection of herself.</p>
			<p>“Is the time coming,” she said, “when even Blanche will see what I am in my face?”</p>
			<p>She turned aside from the glass. With a sudden cry of despair she flung up her arms and laid them heavily against the wall, and rested her head on them with her back to the light. At the same moment a man’s figure appeared⁠—standing dark in the flood of sunshine at the entrance to the summerhouse. The man was Geoffrey Delamayn.</p>
